[SourceNinja](http://www.sourceninja.com) is an easy way to manage the open source software that your application uses. SourceNinja keeps you aware of patches that are released for any open source project or library that you integrate into your application.

The key benefits of using SourceNinja are:

* Understanding what packages need to be updated.
* Having actionable information to determine whether an update should take place.
* Receiving alerts when updates become available for your Open Source packages.

Below are tutorials on how to integrate SourceNinja into your application and begin keeping your packages up-to-date.
